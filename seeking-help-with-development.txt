SEEKING HELP WITH DEVELOPMENT
===========

As of right now, there are several features I would like to implement in this ASAP.
I am looking to speak with skilled coders who can work with me to give this thing wings.

Your work on this project stands to give many good people in this world some of their power back.
And that is a good thing.

The MAIN feature I would like help implementing at this time (to evolve past v.01) is the ability
to call the LP-Warden.php remotely from a file that could stay with the lander it is configured
on (perhaps a javascript file).

The obvious benefits of doing this would be the ability to enable/disable and scale siphon % in
real-time as well as an increased transfer probability when it comes to experienced affiliates
ripping off landing pages. There are many more benefits that come into play once this function
is developed, which I am open to discussing with the right people.

From what I understand about GitHub, the nature of this place is to be collaborative and open-source...
so if you have any bright ideas for this tool, feel free to put them up here! I did my best to enable
all the public settings on here. Hope I did it right.

To Infinity And Beyond,

Zeal
