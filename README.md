LP Warden
===========

PHP script to reclaim lost or stolen traffic back to your landing page. 


Sick of slaving over campaigns, scheming up angles into the dead of night and creating beautiful
artwork (landers) that seem to get ripped by every n00b affiliate with a spy tool?

Then.... WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED! (/cheeze)


*WHAT DOES IT DO?*

By putting a simple piece of PHP on your landers, LP Warden allows you to siphon back traffic
from the damn dirty thieves who steal your precious work!


*HOW MUCH TRAFFIC CAN I RECLAIM?*

That is for you to decide.


*WHO IS IT FOR?*

LP Warden was designed with the everyday affiliate in mind. You might not be stacking heaps of cheese
just yet, but God knows you put a ton of effort into your work and LP Warden can help protect that
work by sending traffic back to your landing pages from those who copy them.


*HOW IT WORKS*

LP Warden works by embedding a piece of PHP code on your landers BEFORE they get spied on and swooped.
This PHP code then stays with your lander when another affiliate swipes and deploys it. The code is run
every time the lander is loaded, whether on your server or on theirs. The code recognizes your lander's
native domain (as defined by you) and if the domain it is being loaded on is not its native domain, it will
redirect the visitor to your desired landing page a certain percentage of the time --you control which
landing page they are taken to and how often the redirect occurs.

Basically, it does its best to compensate you for having your hard work stolen by taking back a piece
of the culprit's traffic.

---All contributions welcome!

I would not call myself a "proper coder" by any means as this was hacked together from some different pieces
of code I found across the internet. If any real coders happen to come by and are interested in working with
me on this project, I would love to work with you!

In future releases, I would like to include a better encryption solution that breaks the LP if removed,
hosting of the LP-Warden.php file on the user's server for dynamic updates AFTER their lander has been copied,
and optimistically a GUI for users to manage all of their redirects in real-time (e.g. skip first 100 clicks,
day-parting and reverse spying to discover culprits' traffic sources, etc).
