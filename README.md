LP-Guardian
===========

PHP script to reclaim lost or stolen traffic back to your landing page.


Sick of slaving over campaigns, scheming up angles into the dead of night and creating beautiful
artwork (landers) that seem to get ripped by every n00b affiliate with a spy tool?

Then.... WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED! (/cheeze)


By putting a simple piece of PHP on your landers, you can actually siphon back traffic
from the nubs who steal your precious work.

HOW MUCH TRAFFIC CAN I RECLAIM?

That is for you to decide.


LP-Guardian was designed with the everyday affiliate in mind. You might not be stacking heaps of cheese
just yet, but God knows you put a ton of effort into your work and LP-Guardian can help protect that
work by sending traffic back to your landing pages from those who copy them.
